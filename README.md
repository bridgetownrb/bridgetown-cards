# How to Contribute to Bridgetown Cards

It's very simple! First, you'll want to fork this repo. Then add a new file to the `src/_cards/2021`/`2022` folder using the following template and a `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` filename:

https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown-cards/blob/main/src/_cards/_CARD_TEMPLATE.md

Commit that to a branch in your forked repo, then submit a Pull Request to this repo with your submission. We'll take a look, and if it makes the cut, we'll publish it!

**Note:** it's fine to link to other article(s) you've written, gems, repos, etc., but we ask that you make sure your submission itself contains the bulk of the information needed to demonstrate your working functionality.
